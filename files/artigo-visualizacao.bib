    ABSTRACT="Developing and keeping the software systems with high quality are difficult tasks. The low understanding of the software structures and the complexity of analysing the impacts of changes in a software system are important impediments to a software evolve without substantial deteriorations. The graphical visualization of the system and its properties – modules, relationship between modules, metrics of modules, metrics of relationships between modules – may allow to better identify possible needs for refactoring, therefore, attenuate the process of deterioration. Aiming to contribute to overcome this issue, a previous work of one of the authors of this paper has defined a model, called Little House, which consists of a macroscopic picture of the object-oriented software structures, based on the bow-tie model that describes the Web. Little House represents a software system as a network which can be partitioned in 6 components. The goal of this work is to develop algorithms to this model and create a software visualization tool that shows the software networks based in Little House.",
